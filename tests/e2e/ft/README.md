# Fault Tolerance E2E Tests

## Overview Table

### CI Entries

- **CI entry files**: `test_<TEST_NAME>__<mode>.py`, or `test_<TEST_NAME>__<kill>.py` when the scenario pins its own topology and takes no mode; split on the first `__` to read the scenario and the rest back out, which is why no scenario name contains one.
- **The segment after the scenario is always the kill segment**: a mode name starts with it, and an entry with no mode carries it alone, so every entry says what its run crashes without anyone opening the file.
- **Entry file content**: `register_cuda_ci(est_time=..., suite=..., labels=[...], hardware=[...])` plus `run_ci(_MODE)` under `__main__`, no test logic.
- **Execution model**: bare `python3 <file>` from the repo root, exit code = pass/fail (`tests/ci/ci_utils.py` `run_unittest_files`).

| Scenario | Modes with an entry file |
| --- | --- |
| `scenario_trainer_no_failure` | `kill_train__dp2_cp2_tp2_ep2__fake_rollout__moe_5layer`, `kill_train__dp2_cp2_pp2__fake_rollout__moe_5layer`, `kill_train__dp4_cp2__fake_rollout__moe_5layer`, `kill_train__dp2_cp2__moe_5layer` |
| `scenario_trainer_deterministic` | `kill_train__dp2_cp2_tp2_ep2__fake_rollout__moe_5layer`, `kill_train__dp2_cp2_pp2__fake_rollout__moe_5layer`, `kill_train__dp4_cp2__fake_rollout__moe_5layer`, `kill_train__dp2_cp2__moe_5layer` |
| `scenario_trainer_with_failure` | `kill_train__dp2_cp2_tp2_ep2__fake_rollout__moe_5layer`, `kill_train__dp2_cp2_pp2__fake_rollout__moe_5layer`, `kill_train__dp4_cp2__fake_rollout__moe_5layer`, `kill_train__dp2_cp2` |
| `scenario_rollout_deterministic` | `kill_rollout__dp4__colocate` |
| `scenario_random_crash` | `kill_train__dp2_cp2_tp2_ep2__fake_rollout__moe_5layer`, `kill_train__dp2_cp2__moe_5layer`, `kill_train_rollout__dp2_cp2`, `kill_rollout__dp4__colocate` |
| `scenario_realistic_gsm8k` | `test_realistic_gsm8k__kill_train_rollout.py`, no modes |
| `scenario_random_crash_fully_async` | `kill_train_rollout__dp2_cp2` |
| `scenario_realistic_gsm8k_fully_async` | `test_realistic_gsm8k_fully_async__kill_train_rollout.py`, no modes |
| `scenario_inference_scaling` | `test_inference_scaling__kill_rollout.py`, no modes |

- **Forced absences**, one reason each:
    - `kill_train__dp4_cp2_tp2_pp2_ep2_etp2__moe_full` is multi-node, and no multi-node CI lane exists.
    - `kill_rollout__dp4__colocate` fits only the scenarios that crash engines.
    - `scenario_rollout_deterministic` needs real engines and `ft_components == ("rollout",)` exactly.
    - The fully-async soaks reject modes without real engines or with colocation.
    - `kill_train__dp2_cp2` supersedes `kill_train__dp2_cp2__moe_5layer` in `scenario_trainer_with_failure`.
- **Every other absence is an unclaimed cell**, not a decision — adding an entry file is all it takes.

### Scenarios

- **Scenario logic**: `conftest_ft/scenario_<name>.py` — a typer app plus a `run_ci(mode)` runner.

| Scenario (`conftest_ft/scenario_*.py`) | Type | What it verifies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `scenario_trainer_no_failure` | comparison | indep_dp matches normal DP when no faults |
| `scenario_trainer_with_failure` | comparison, multi-phase | indep_dp matches normal DP after fault + ckpt resume |
| `scenario_trainer_deterministic` | comparison, multi-phase | healing state transfer is bitwise-correct, on cold start and on resume from a post-healing ckpt |
| `scenario_rollout_deterministic` | comparison | engine crashes change training bits not at all |
| `scenario_random_crash` | soak | system survives random crashes without hanging |
| `scenario_realistic_gsm8k` | soak | model still reaches gsm8k accuracy under random crashes |
| `scenario_random_crash_fully_async` | soak | same, through `train_async.py --fully-async` |
| `scenario_realistic_gsm8k_fully_async` | soak | same, through `train_async.py --fully-async` |
| `scenario_inference_scaling` | soak | the engine pool grows and shrinks under a live run, and the run follows it |

### Modes

- **Selection**: `--mode`, defined in `conftest_ft/modes.py`; `scenario_realistic_gsm8k` takes none.
- **Mode names**: `<kill>__<parallelism>[__fake_rollout][__moe_5layer|__moe_full][__colocate]`, segments separated by `__` and joined by `_` inside a segment.
- **What a name carries**: the `kill` segment always, then only the axes that differ from the naming defaults — real sglang engines, the dense `Qwen3-0.6B`, disaggregated placement. Node counts, engine counts and cell counts are never in the name; read them from the table below.
- **Why `kill` leads**: what a run crashes is the subject of this suite, so it is the first thing the name answers, and it is a property of the mode alone — no scenario widens it at runtime.
- **The scheme is enforced, not remembered**: `compute_mode_name` derives a mode's name from its fields against an explicit naming-default table, and `tests/fast/e2e/ft/test_naming_scheme.py` fails when a name drifts from it.
- **Declared per mode**: cell count, parallelism, model, train/rollout GPU split, `colocate` (default disaggregated, i.e. training and rollout on separate nodes), `ft_components` (default `("train",)`).
- **No rollout engines**: modes with `rollout_num_engines == 0` train on pre-recorded debug rollout data.

| Mode | Nodes | GPUs (train + rollout) | DP cells | Parallelism | Rollout | Model | `ft_components` | Why it exists |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `kill_train__dp2_cp2_tp2_ep2__fake_rollout__moe_5layer` | 1 | 8 + 0 | 2 | CP2 TP2 EP2 | debug data | 5-layer MoE | `("train",)` | TP + EP coverage |
| `kill_train__dp2_cp2_pp2__fake_rollout__moe_5layer` | 1 | 8 + 0 | 2 | CP2 PP2 | debug data | 5-layer MoE | `("train",)` | PP coverage, via `--decoder-first-pipeline-num-layers 3 --decoder-last-pipeline-num-layers 2` |
| `kill_train__dp4_cp2__fake_rollout__moe_5layer` | 1 | 8 + 0 | 4 | CP2 | debug data | 5-layer MoE | `("train",)` | multi-replica coverage (>= 4 cells); uneven split after a fault |
| `kill_train__dp2_cp2__moe_5layer` | 1 | 4 + 4 | 2 | CP2 | 4 engines × 1 GPU | 5-layer MoE | `("train",)` | real engines + the weight-update path |
| `kill_train__dp2_cp2` | 1 | 4 + 4 | 2 | CP2 | 4 engines × 1 GPU | dense Qwen3-0.6B | `("train",)` | `scenario_trainer_with_failure` under real generation; needs the dense model (see below) |
| `kill_rollout__dp4__colocate` | 1 | 4 shared | 4 | — | 4 engines × 1 GPU, colocated | dense Qwen3-0.6B | `("rollout",)` | the only rollout-only mode: crashes engines, not trainer cells |
| `kill_train_rollout__dp2_cp2` | 1 | 4 + 4 | 2 | CP2 | 4 engines × 1 GPU | dense Qwen3-0.6B | `("train", "rollout")` | both kinds crash in the same run, sync and fully-async; disaggregated, since colocation makes the two crashes contend for the same gpus |
| `kill_train__dp4_cp2_tp2_pp2_ep2_etp2__moe_full` | 4 train + 2 rollout | 32 + 16 | 4 | CP2 TP2 PP2 EP2 ETP2 | 2 engines × 8 GPU | full MoE | `("train",)` | full model, all parallelism; multi-node, so no CI entry |

- **Batch shape**: `--rollout-batch-size 32 --n-samples-per-prompt 8 --global-batch-size 256` everywhere — 256 samples per rollout, divisible by both 2 and 4 cells. `scenario_trainer_with_failure` x `kill_train__dp4_cp2__fake_rollout__moe_5layer` trains the fault rollout on the 3 surviving cells, so the uneven 256-over-3 split is exercised there.
- **Model**: 1-node modes use the 5-layer MoE `Qwen3-30B-A3B-5layer`, except the three dense modes.

## Running the code

### In CI

- **Gating labels**: `run-ci-ft-short` for the comparison scenarios (minutes each), `run-ci-ft-long` for the soaks (tens of minutes to hours). Nothing here runs on an unlabelled PR.
- **Broad scopes**: `run-ci-all` includes both; the nightly cadence includes `ft-short` but not `ft-long`; `run-ci-image` excludes both.
- **Suite**: `suite="stage-c-8-gpu-h200"`, run by the job of the same name in `.github/workflows/pr-test.yml`.
- **Hardware**: every entry declares `hardware=["hopper", "blackwell"]`.
- **ft-long is disabled**: every ft-long entry passes `disabled="FT soak tests pending CI infra support"`, and `tests/ci/run_suite.py` drops every test with a non-`None` `disabled`, so `run-ci-ft-long` executes nothing. Unblocked by an ft-long capable lane; nothing in the tests is known broken.
- **Fast-layer stand-in**: `tests/fast/e2e/ft/test_rollout_gated_recovery.py` covers suspend → gated relaunch → recovery on CPU meanwhile.
- **Add a `(scenario, mode)`**: copy an entry file, change `_MODE`.
- **Add a label**: an entry in `tests/ci/labels.py` plus the matching `run-ci-<key>` GitHub label; the workflow needs no edit.

### Manually

`PYTHONPATH` must point at the repo root (CI sets it automatically).

```bash
# One mode, exactly as CI runs it
PYTHONPATH=. python tests/e2e/ft/test_trainer_no_failure__kill_train__dp2_cp2_tp2_ep2__fake_rollout__moe_5layer.py

# Any mode, including the ones with no entry file
PYTHONPATH=. python tests/e2e/ft/conftest_ft/scenario_trainer_no_failure.py run --mode kill_train__dp4_cp2__fake_rollout__moe_5layer
```

| Subcommand | Does | Available in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `run` | full pipeline: prepare + every phase's baseline/target + compare | all scenarios |
| `baseline` / `target` | one side only, for debugging | comparison scenarios |
| `compare` | re-run the comparison on existing dumps (no GPU) | comparison scenarios |
| `generate-data` | record debug rollout data with real engines, no dumper | comparison scenarios |

- **Debugging**: prefer the individual subcommands over `run` — with a shared `--dump-dir` (plus `--phase` when multi-phase) you re-run only what changed.
- **`scenario_rollout_deterministic`**: the comparison subcommands, with the injection constants fixed in the module rather than exposed as options.
- **`scenario_random_crash`**: only `run`, with `--mode` / `--seed` / `--num-steps` / `--trainer-crash-interval-seconds` / `--rollout-crash-interval-seconds` / `--fully-async`.
- **`scenario_realistic_gsm8k`**: only `run`, with `--seed` / `--num-rollout` / `--trainer-crash-interval-seconds` / `--rollout-crash-interval-seconds` / `--metric-threshold` / `--fully-async`; no `--mode`.
- **`scenario_*_fully_async`**: only `run`, with the same options minus `--fully-async`, which they pin.
- **Dumps**: `resolve_dump_dir` in `conftest_ft/app.py` puts them under `$MILES_TEST_DUMPS_ROOT/<run_id>/<test_name>/`, falling back to `/node_public/dumps` when the cluster sets no root. A comparison scenario's `run` deletes them when it ends; the soak scenarios (`scenario_random_crash`, `scenario_realistic_gsm8k`) only clear a stale directory before starting, so a finished soak leaves its dumps behind for inspection. The run id is what stops two agents running the same test from deleting each other's dumps.

### Cluster Backend

- **Selection**: `command_utils.default_config()`, off `MILES_SCRIPT_CLUSTER_BACKEND` / `MILES_SCRIPT_NAMESPACE` / `MILES_SCRIPT_RUN_ID`, already set in the miles-workbench pod.
- **Scenarios stay backend-agnostic**: no mode declares one; the backend changes only the set of fault forms.
- **One config throughout**: the same `ExecuteTrainConfig` threads through `prepare()`, `run_training()` and `api_server_host()`; on kubernetes the api server lives on a pod named after its `run_id`, so a second config would aim the injector at a release that does not exist.
- **Side-specific releases**: a comparison may provide `config_for_side`; the pipeline applies it once before the target context and launch, which both receive that same transformed config.
- **Bounded side handoff**: after each kubernetes comparison side, including a failed one, the pipeline uninstalls its Helm release and waits at most five minutes for both the release and every release-labelled pod to disappear. The next side and the CPU comparison start only after that completes, so asynchronous chart cleanup cannot overlap their GPU reservations. Ray comparisons never call Helm.
- **Unreachable is a failure, not a skip**: `create_backend_for_run()` asserts before handing back a backend, since exiting 0 would report green for a test that never ran.
- **Namespaced probes only**: never a cluster-scoped CRD read, which the workbench's Role cannot do.

### Generate Debug Rollout Data

- **Who uses it**: modes with `has_real_rollout == False`, through `--load-debug-rollout-data --debug-train-only`.
- **Where it comes from**: `prepare()` in `conftest_ft/execution.py`, via `U.hf_download_dataset()` on `fzyzcjy/miles-test-rollout-Qwen3-30B-A3B-5layer`.
- **Soak reuse**: `materialize_cyclic_debug_rollout_data()` symlinks the recorded files cyclically under the shared data dir, so a soak can run more steps than were recorded and the run pod can read the links.
- **Regenerating it needs the 5-layer model**: the full model's `rollout_log_probs` are incompatible with the 5-layer training model and produce NaN GRPO gradients.

```bash
# 1. Generate with the 5-layer model and real sglang engines (no dumper)
PYTHONPATH=. python tests/e2e/ft/conftest_ft/scenario_trainer_no_failure.py generate-data \
    --mode kill_train__dp2_cp2__moe_5layer --num-steps 12 --output-dir /tmp/gen_rollout

# 2. Inspect
ls /tmp/gen_rollout/rollout_data/

# 3. Upload
hf upload --repo-type dataset fzyzcjy/miles-test-rollout-Qwen3-30B-A3B-5layer \
    /tmp/gen_rollout/rollout_data/
```

## Test Specifications

### Comparison Criterion

- **Dumps**: per-tensor predicates over `rel` / `max_abs` / `mean_abs`, as `compare_dumps(diff_thresholds=[(name_regex, predicate), ...])` onto the sglang comparator's `--diff-threshold`.
- **Fail-closed**: a tensor matching no regex fails, so every list ends with a `.*` catch-all and the specific families come first.
- **Model inputs**: `INPUT_TENSORS_ALLOW_FAILED_PATTERN` exempts `input_ids`, `positions`, `cu_seqlens_*`, `qkv_format`; `INPUT_TENSORS_SKIP_PATTERN` skips those plus `.*witness.*`. Nothing else is exempt.
- **Metrics**: `compare_metrics` reads `MetricEvent`s, requires `train/grad_norm` and `train/loss` in the baseline and equal event counts on both sides, and compares only the highest-attempt event per rollout id.

- **Why only some are bitwise**: baseline and target reduce over different topologies, so allreduce kernel ordering differs — unless `--deterministic-mode` and `--debug-deterministic-collective` are on.
- **Why `train/grad_norm` is exempt in `scenario_trainer_deterministic`**: it sums squared shard fragments, so its bracketing follows the dist-optimizer shard count (8 flat vs 2 per cell); a few fp32 ulps are inherent. The grads stay bitwise-checked through the dumps. It is exact in `scenario_rollout_deterministic`, where ft on rollout alone leaves one trainer topology and no shard-count bracketing to excuse.

### Fault Forms and Receivers

| Backend | Cell type | Forms, drawn from uniformly |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ray | actor | `inject_fault:sigkill`, `inject_fault:exit`, `inject_fault:segfault` |
| ray | rollout | `inject_fault:sigkill` |
| kubernetes | actor | those three kills, plus `delete_pod` |
| kubernetes | rollout | `exec_sigkill`, `delete_pod` |

- **Each `FailureMode` is its own form**: pod deletion is a quarter of a kubernetes trainer injection, not half of it.
- **The actor class decides what a kill means**, since an injection carries only a mode and a `sub_index`: `TrainRayActor` and `ServeActor` crash their own process, the only thing that costs torchft a member, while `CommandActor` SIGKILLs the isolated process group rooted at the engine subprocess. That includes the launch shell and every engine child it spawned, so a dead cell cannot leave an orphaned scheduler holding GPU memory while its replacement starts; the Ray actor observes the subprocess exit and reports the death as production sees it.
- **Why an engine takes sigkill alone**: exiting and segfaulting are what a process does to itself from the inside, and no signal reproduces them from outside — SIGTERM is a clean shutdown, SIGSEGV is delivered rather than provoked. The other modes are refused, not approximated.
- **How a kubernetes engine takes a kill**: its pod runs sglang as the entrypoint (`BaseCommandSpec`), so no actor and no rpc server exist to receive `inject_fault`. The kill is delivered from outside instead, as a `kubectl exec` SIGKILL of the sglang processes in the engine container, and deleting the pod is the second, coarser form — the engine *is* the pod.
- **Deletion is the test layer's own `kubectl delete pod`**, timeout-bounded and selecting on release, pool and cell index. It models an outsider, and deliberately avoids the production heal path `KubernetesCellOperations.suspend`, whose bugs an injector sharing it would hide.

### `scenario_trainer_no_failure`

```
Type: comparison (baseline=normal DP, target=indep_dp)
Steps: 2 (NUM_STEPS)
Compare: dumps rel <= 0.0085; metrics rtol=1e-2, atol=1e-8

1. Baseline: normal DP on debug rollout data (real engines in a real-rollout mode)
2. Target: the same arguments plus get_ft_args(mode), which is --use-fault-tolerance
   --ft-components <the mode's ft_components> --api-server-port 0
3. Compare:
   - Tensor-level: compare_dumps (weights, grads via dumper & sglang comparator)
   - Metric-level: compare_metrics (MetricEvent, requires train/grad_norm and train/loss)
   - Rank matching: grouping_skip_keys=["rank", "dp", "edp"], the two sides differing in
     world size and DP layout

Roughly equal, not bitwise - allreduce kernel ordering differs across topologies.
```

### `scenario_trainer_with_failure`

```
Type: comparison, multi-phase (phase_a + phase_b)
Steps: phase_a 1 rollout (id 0), phase_b 3 rollouts (ids 1..3)
  --num-rollout 4: exclusive global end id, not a per-run count
Compare: phase_b dumps per rollout, rel <= 0.0085 plus the max_abs floors below;
         metrics rtol=5e-2, atol=1e-7

Phase A (both sides):
  1. Run 1 rollout
  2. Save checkpoint (--save-interval 1), exit

Phase B - baseline:
  1. Resume from the phase_a checkpoint
  2. Run 3 normal rollouts (1..3)

Phase B - target:
  1. Resume from the phase_a checkpoint
  2. Rollout 1: N cells normal
  3. Rollout 2, attempt 0: crash_before_allreduce on last cell rank 0
     -> os._exit(1) -> allreduce timeout -> should_commit=false -> retry
  4. Rollout 2, attempt 1: reconfigure to N-1 cells, commit on the degraded quorum
  5. After rollout 2: stop_cell_at_end(last) + start_cell_at_end(last)
  6. Rollout 3: heal back to N cells, train with the healed cell

Fault injection: --ci-ft-test-actions, JSON list of {at_rollout, action, cell_id, rank, attempt}
  at_rollout: rollout id; attempt: retry attempt, actor-level actions only
  stop_cell_at_end / start_cell_at_end: trainer controller, suspend/resume via cell_operations
  crash_before_allreduce: inside the targeted actor

Healing witness: target phase_b event dir, exactly two CellReconfigureEvents
  rollout 2: shrink, alive N -> N-1
  rollout 3: heal, healed = last cell, ckpt src = cell 0, alive back to N
  baseline and phase_a dirs: zero
Dump-leaf witness: {fwd_bwd/rollout_<id> leaf dirs} == {rollouts the comparison loop walks}
```

- **Why the healing witness**: without it the comparison degenerates into two fault-free runs that trivially agree; the shrink proves the injection fired.
- **Why the dump-leaf witness**: a newly added leaf dir would otherwise skip comparison unnoticed.

Grad families with a `max_abs` floor (cancellation-dominated near-zero grads; real grads sit around `1e-2`):

| Rollouts | Families | Floor |
| --- | --- | --- |
| all | MoE expert grads, QK-norm (`q_layernorm` / `k_layernorm`) grads | `max_abs <= 1e-3` |
| injected ones, real-rollout mode only | QK-norms, folded `layer_norm_weight`s, `linear_qkv` / `linear_proj` / `mlp.linear_fc[12]` weights | `max_abs <= 3e-3` |

- **Where `3e-3` comes from**: the degraded commit's ulp drift lands as <= 2.8e-3 absolute noise in those near-zero grads (40 tensors, 2026-06-12), against real grads around `1e-2`. Embedding, output, final-norm grads, every activation and every pre-fault rollout keep the strict set.

#### `kill_train__dp2_cp2` mode

`scenario_trainer_with_failure` against live generation: real sglang engines, deterministic inference, temperature 0.8.

- **Pre-fault rollouts need bitwise weights on both sides**: the fault rollout trains the target's own live samples, and one bf16 ulp in a weight flips temperature-0.8 samples so the fault rollout trains different data (observed as a 6% `train/grad_norm` gap once the sglang v0.5.18 bump changed the sampled content). Both sides therefore run `--debug-deterministic-collective` (the same fixed fold for the normal-DP 4-rank reduce and the indep_dp CP-then-cross-cell reduce, as in `scenario_trainer_deterministic`) and `--clip-grad 10.0` (clipping inactive: the dense grad norm is ~1.3, and `train/grad_norm` differs by a few fp32 ulps across shardings, which an active clip would multiply into every update). The other FT modes have grad norms below 1.0, so clipping is inactive there without the override.
- **Post-fault rollouts are injected**: `--ci-inject-rollout-data-path` replays the baseline's `--save-debug-rollout-data` recording from rollout 3 on (crash rollout + 1).
- **Why inject**: the degraded-quorum commit brackets microbatch accumulation differently, and under live sampling that ulp diff flips tokens until the two runs' rollout data diverges wholesale. It is fault-inherent -- no collective ordering removes it. Injecting makes training inputs identical by construction, keeping the comparison strict.
- **The target stays real**: engines and generation still run (samples discarded), `update_weights` fires after the degraded commit and after healing, the health monitor pauses and resumes — the whole crash → retry → heal → weight-sync path. Engine checksums are not compared here; only `scenario_trainer_deterministic` does that.
- **Generation is still asserted**: `RolloutDataInjectionUtil.assert_matches_generated` requires bitwise-identical prompt tokens per sample, plus a mean response-token match ratio above `--ci-inject-rollout-data-min-match-ratio`, set to 0.5 here (the flag's own default is 0.9). A broken `update_weights` drops that ratio by ~2 orders.
- **Not asserted**: exact post-fault sampled content beyond the ratio; pre-fault rollouts are compared for real.

Guard calibration (2026-06-12, first post-fault rollout, 256 samples, correct weights; a response counts as mismatched from its first flipped token on):

| Model | Mean response-token match | Min |
| --- | --- | --- |
| dense Qwen3-0.6B | **0.63** | 0.035 |
| 5-layer MoE | **0.19** | 0.005 |

- **Why dense**: on the truncated MoE, uncalibrated logits plus router near-ties amplify the drift to 0.19, indistinguishable from unrelated content; dense's 0.63 sits 2 orders above that, so 0.5 separates them.

### `scenario_trainer_deterministic`

```
Type: comparison, multi-phase (phase_a + phase_b)
Steps: 3 rollouts per phase - phase_a 0..2, phase_b 3..5
  --num-rollout 6: exclusive global end id
  --debug-exit-after-rollout 3: counts within the run, fires after that rollout's ckpt save
  --save-interval 3 (NUM_ROLLOUTS_PER_PHASE): one ckpt at each phase's last rollout
Compare: BOTH phases' dumps rel <= 0 (bitwise); metrics rtol=0 / atol=0, except
         train/grad_norm at rtol=1e-6

One shared builder parameterized by the phase's start rollout id P; only the start regime differs:
  phase_a: cold start (no --load, so no_load_optim/no_load_rng/finetune) - rollouts 0..2 (P=0)
  phase_b: resumes from phase_a's post-healing rollout-2 ckpt (start_rollout_id = loaded + 1
           = 3) - rollouts 3..5 (P=3)

Per-phase baseline: rollouts P..P+2 all normal, no stop/start, no healing

Per-phase target:
  1. Rollout P, P+1: all N cells normal
  2. After rollout P+1: stop_cell_at_end(last) + start_cell_at_end(last)
  3. Rollout P+2: heal at the start (recv_ckpt from cell 0), then normal execution

Determinism: --deterministic-mode, plus NCCL_ALGO=Ring, NVTE_ALLOW_NONDETERMINISTIC_ALGO=0,
  CUBLAS_WORKSPACE_CONFIG=:4096:8, SGLANG_FLASHINFER_PREFILL_SPLIT_TILE_SIZE=8192
  --debug-deterministic-collective: fixed-tree SUM folds, making normal DP's and indep_dp's
    reduction topologies bitwise-comparable

Cross-cell check: --use-fault-tolerance --ft-components train auto-enables
  --save-local-weight-checksum and --enable-event-analyzer
  cross_replica_weight_checksum: cell-to-cell bitwise equality, every rollout attempt,
    post-healing included
Engine checksum (real-rollout modes only): one InferenceEngineWeightChecksumEvent per
  update_weights, carrying every engine's checksum
  _compare, per phase: baseline and target pushed identical weights per (rollout, engine)
  inference_engine_weight_checksum_consistency: all engines of one rollout agree

Healing witness: one heal per target phase, at P+2 (healed = last cell, ckpt src = cell 0,
  alive back to N); no standalone shrink - one _refresh_cells absorbs the stop+start pair
  the event dir is snapshotted into the ckpt and restored on --load, hence:
    target phase_a: heal at rollout 2
    target phase_b: heal at rollout 2 (restored with the ckpt) + heal at rollout 5
    both baselines: zero reconfigure events
```

- **Why P+2 must exist**: healing runs at its start, so a shorter phase never executes the path under test.
- **Why zero tolerance**: a state-copy bug in healing is easy to make and an approximate check would miss it.
- **What phase_b adds**: reproducing the baseline bit-for-bit also proves the ckpt round-trips bitwise.
- **Why the healing witness**: it gates the off-by-one bug where healing never runs and the comparison passes on two fault-free runs.

### `scenario_rollout_deterministic`

```
Type: comparison; both sides run the identical command, only the target is wrapped in the
      fault injector, through the pipeline's target_side_context hook
Entry: test_rollout_deterministic__kill_rollout__dp4__colocate.py, ft-long
Steps: 8 rollouts (NUM_ROLLOUTS)
Requires: mode.has_real_rollout, and ft_components == ("rollout",) exactly
Compare: dumps rel <= 0 (bitwise); metrics rtol=0 / atol=0 over train/* and rollout/*,
         train/grad_norm included

Regime (both sides):
  - the shared deterministic rollout recipe: --sglang-enable-deterministic-inference,
    --sglang-attention-backend flashinfer and --deterministic-mode
  - --debug-deterministic-collective and scenario_trainer_deterministic's deterministic env vars
  - --sglang-disable-radix-cache
  - --rollout-health-check-interval 1

Injection (target side only):
  1. Rollout cells, seed 42, exponential mean CRASH_INTERVAL_SECONDS (30s)
  2. Forms drawn per (cluster backend, cell type), as in the soaks
  3. Stop accepting faults after six completed rollouts, leaving the final two rollouts for recovery
  4. Stop the injector, waiting out a mid-flight injection for at most
     STOP_AND_JOIN_TIMEOUT_SECONDS (180s), then re-use the soak's rollout witnesses: >= 2
     accepted rollout injections, each paired with one completed recovery cycle

Assertions:
  1. Reconfigure events: zero on BOTH sides - crashing an engine must not reconfigure trainer cells
  2. Metrics: rtol=atol=0 over train/* and rollout/*
  3. Dumps: rel <= 0
  4. Engine checksums: baseline and target pushed identical weights per (rollout, engine)
  5. Weights moved, per side: the engine weight checksum is not identical across all rollouts
```

- **Why it exists**: an engine dying and being replaced mid-generation is supposed to be invisible to training, and "invisible" is a claim about bits; the rollout soak only ever asserted survival.
- **Why the shared deterministic recipe**: the assertion is deterministic replay across fresh inference engines, not true-on-policy training. Reusing the same FlashInfer recipe as the main deterministic trainer-FT test avoids a second, incompatible attention-backend contract.
- **Why `--sglang-disable-radix-cache`**: a replacement engine serves with a cold prefix cache where the baseline's was warm, and deterministic inference is nowhere documented as prefix-cache-length invariant.
- **Why this recipe disables batch-variant MM fallback**: a rollout worker loss changes co-batching while the pool is healing; permitting an `einsum` fallback would make the same seeded request depend on that temporary batch shape. The scenario injects the environment override without changing the production default.
- **Why `--rollout-health-check-interval 1`**: healthy generation can finish between two five-second polls; the short scenario needs at least one fresh Serving observation before its lock-protected injection attempt.
- **Why this scenario polls the fault window every 0.2 seconds**: colocated generation windows are only a few seconds long, so the generic two-second scheduler cadence can miss every Serving observation in an eight-rollout run.
- **Why one quiescent poll on Ray only**: colocate exposes Serving only between train phases, and on Ray the injection endpoint takes the inference-controller lock and atomically rejects inactive servers, so the generic stable-serving gate is redundant. The Kubernetes forms (`exec_sigkill`, `delete_pod`) act on the pod without that lock, so a stale Serving poll or a slow `kubectl` would land the fault after the colocated engines are already offloaded; Kubernetes therefore keeps the generic 60-poll gate.
- **Why the final two rollouts accept no new fault**: the scheduler keeps observing recovery but closes admission after rollout 5, so teardown cannot race a newly accepted replacement.
- **Why Ray checks Serving again inside the injection lock**: the lock excludes weight-update and offload transitions, while the Serving check also rejects the subsequent colocated trainer phase after `offload()` has released the lock.
- **Why every namespace, not just `train/`**: an engine crash shows up first in `rollout/raw_reward` or `rollout/log_probs`. `perf/` is left out by name, being wall-clock and throughput that a relaunch moves by definition, and a metric in neither namespace fails the run rather than being dropped quietly.
- **Why the weights-moved gate**: bitwise equality is also satisfied by two runs that trained on nothing.
- **Why not a loss or reward curve**: neither is a progress signal here — the reward is `deterministic_random`, a hash of the response, and GRPO's surrogate loss is not monotone even while a run learns. Over eight rollouts neither moves for a reason worth asserting, and the weights either changed or they did not.

### `scenario_random_crash`

```
Type: soak (no baseline, no compare); passes if training completes without hanging and the
      witnesses hold
Steps: 60 (default)
CLI: --mode, --seed (42), --num-steps (60), --trainer-crash-interval-seconds (120),
     --rollout-crash-interval-seconds (240), --fully-async (off)

Targeting and assertions follow the mode's ft_components:
  ("train",)          -> inject into "actor" cells, assert trainer healing
  ("rollout",)        -> inject into "rollout" cells, assert the recovery cycle
  ("train","rollout") -> inject into both kinds, assert both
  A mode declaring rollout ft without real engines would schedule injections into a cell kind
    that does not exist, so FTTestMode refuses to be constructed at all

Architecture (external fault injection, not inside the training loop):
  1. Start indep_dp training + api server (port 18080) + --mini-ft-controller-enable
  2. A background daemon thread iterates every 2s:
     a. GET /api/v1/cells, keeping only the targeted cell types
     b. Append that whole snapshot to the injector's event log, its only state
     c. Collect the cell kinds whose own schedule is due; stop here if none
     d. A due kind is ready only at a quiescent point: every replica of that kind present,
        Healthy and (for rollout) Serving for 60 consecutive polls (~120s) - long enough to
        outlast the ~95s stale-status window - and at least one spare replica to survive
        the kill
     e. Draw a ready kind, a cell of that kind and one of its fault forms - preferring a form
        the log shows has never worked - apply it, record the attempt, reset that kind's
        quiescence streak, then draw its next injection time
  3. inject_fault() runs on the actor's own ray concurrency group thread and kills the process,
     or the test layer deletes the pod on kubernetes
  4. The health checker notices by heartbeat timeout
  5. The mini FT controller recovers it (suspend -> resume)
  6. Verify: training completes, no hangs, prod assertions pass

Per-kind schedules: exponential, mean that kind's --*-crash-interval-seconds

Witnesses, counted per kind:
  forms   -> every form the enabled components make available succeeded at least once, so a
             soak that clears the injection floors on one form still has to draw the others
  train   -> >= 2 accepted actor injections, >= 2 healed cells across the
             CellReconfigureEvents, and every injected cell index paired with a healing of
             that same index - no debt left when training ends
  rollout -> >= 2 accepted rollout injections, and every injected cell observed Serving
             at least once on a reading taken >= 120s after its last injection - late
             enough that the ~95s stale-status window cannot have produced it

Faults are random, so beyond the witnesses neither an exact sequence nor the end-state
membership is asserted.
```

- **Why per-kind schedules and counting**: each kind's cadence stays what it would be in a single-kind soak, and the trainer assertion reads only `actor` injections while the rollout one reads only `rollout` — a mixed soak cannot let one kind's crashes pay for the other's missing heal.
- **Why rollout gets the longer interval**: the replacement pays a full sglang launch plus a weight sync before it can serve again.
- **No per-kind quota**: when the trainer has no spare replica for a long stretch every injection lands on rollout, and the failure form is a loud "too few trainer injections" rather than a silent pass.
- **Why injections wait for quiescence**: the api server reports a just-killed cell Healthy for ~95s, far longer than the poll interval, and indep_dp cannot heal from zero survivors, so a naive Healthy count would eventually kill the last replica. A 60-poll all-serving streak (~120s, the same bound the recovery witness uses) outlasts that window, so by the time a kind is ready again its readings are fresh and every replica really serves; the injector itself keeps no per-cell recovery state to corrupt. A failed injection attempt forfeits the streak too - the kill, not the response, may be what survived the failure.
- **A form that leaves its cell running**: `BaseFaultForm.harms_cell` is false for it, so the draw is recorded without charging that cell a recovery; the reset quiescence streak alone paces the next injection.
- **Why quiescence requires `Serving`, not just `Healthy`**: `Healthy` and even `Running` include a replacement that got weights but cannot answer requests yet, so a kind counting such a replica as recovered would be injected into mid-relaunch.
- **Why quiescence counts replicas against the most ever seen**: a deleted pod vanishes from the listing instead of reading unhealthy, and the survivors all serve; only the missing replica says the kind is still recovering.
- **Why every enabled form has to land**: the floors count injections, not forms, so `inject_fault:sigkill` alone could clear them while `delete_pod` is never tried. This witness makes the draw's preference for an untried form binding.
- **Why the per-cell pairing**: a floor of ">= 2 healings" passes whenever the last crash never recovered. The default intervals are short enough that a soak reliably clears the floors.
- **Why the step budget is 60**: a rollout injection needs a 60-poll (~120s) quiescent streak plus a mean-240s exponential wait, and a weight update resets the streak, so the second accepted rollout injection the witness demands takes well over ten minutes. The budget buys that time instead of lowering the quiescence gate that keeps the injector from killing a kind's last live replica.
- **Why the rollout witness is one-sided**: the trainer witness reads the run's own CellReconfigureEvents, which miss nothing; the rollout witness reads sampled polls, which miss windows by construction. It therefore never demands seeing the down half of a recovery - it demands a Serving reading fresh enough (>= 120s after the cell's last injection, past the ~95s staleness) to prove the survivor really serves. Undercounting an intermediate recovery cannot fail the run; claiming one that never happened cannot pass it.
- **Stopping the injector**: `stop_and_join` asserts the thread actually stopped, since a thread still mid-injection could crash a cell nothing will heal, and would race the witness being read.

### `scenario_realistic_gsm8k`

```
Type: soak (no baseline run; reference = the baseline test's wandb curves)
Entry: test_realistic_gsm8k__kill_train_rollout.py, no mode variants
CLI: --seed (42), --num-rollout (250), --trainer-crash-interval-seconds (600),
     --rollout-crash-interval-seconds (1200), --metric-threshold (0.55), --fully-async (off);
     no --mode

Recipe: Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct, GRPO, 250 rollouts, over the gsm8k RL recipe of
        tests/e2e/long/test_qwen2.5_0.5B_gsm8k.py, whose regular CI runs are the no-fault
        reference wandb curves
Layout: mirrors kill_train__dp2_cp2__moe_5layer - 2 cells x CP2 on 4 train GPUs + 4 rollout engines
        x 1 GPU, disaggregated
Faults: scenario_random_crash's injection loop (shared conftest_ft/fault_injection/), with
        --ft-components train rollout asked for outright, so both trainer cells and engines crash

Assertions:
  1. --ci-metric-checker-key eval/gsm8k against a threshold that must stay identical to the
     no-fault baseline's (0.55); passes if ANY eval reaches it
  2. assert_healing, shared with scenario_random_crash, so both the trainer reconfigure
     assertions and the rollout recovery witness apply here

Fault recovery must not cost end-to-end learning, which the comparison scenarios cannot observe.
```

- **Why the threshold does not move**: it is the entire value of this scenario, so engine crashes are paid for with a lower rollout crash rate, never with a lower bar.

### `scenario_random_crash_fully_async` and `scenario_realistic_gsm8k_fully_async`

```
Type: shells - each calls its sync twin with fully_async=True and pins nothing else
Entries: test_random_crash_fully_async__kill_train_rollout__dp2_cp2.py,
         test_realistic_gsm8k_fully_async__kill_train_rollout.py (no mode)
Differs from the twin: train_async.py instead of train.py, plus --fully-async
                       --pause-generation-mode in_place; test name gains a _fully_async suffix,
                       which separates the dump dirs and wandb runs
Same as the twin: model, parallelism, batch sizes, CLI and every assertion, by construction
```

- **Why it matters**: production fully-async keeps the engines generating across weight updates, so a crash lands the system in states no strictly-alternating soak reaches.
- **Why `--pause-generation-mode in_place`**: the default retract mode can deadlock `flush_cache` under load, and a soak whose verdict is "training finished without hanging" cannot tell that deadlock from the failure it exists to catch.
- **Asserted before the cluster comes up**: the mode has real engines and is not colocated. Recorded rollout data would prove nothing about generating while training, and `train_async.py` rejects colocation outright.
- **Deliberately uncovered**: `train_async.py` without `--fully-async`, the strictly easier case, at tens of minutes to hours of 8-GPU time per soak.

### `scenario_inference_scaling`

```
Type: soak (no baseline, no compare); kubernetes only, the pool is a LeaderWorkerSet there
Entry: test_inference_scaling__kill_rollout.py, no mode: the topology is pinned in the module
Steps: 12 rollouts (NUM_ROLLOUTS)
Layout: dense Qwen3-0.6B, 2 cells x CP2 on 4 train GPUs + 2 engines x 1 GPU, disaggregated,
        --ft-components rollout, api server + mini ft controller as in the soaks; 7 GPUs at the peak

Mechanism: the driver thread patches spec.replicas of the engine pool's LeaderWorkerSet (kubectl
        patch, conftest_ft/scaling.py) while the run is training a scheduled rollout - the engines
        are idle then, so nothing is mid-generation on the pod that goes away. Kubernetes creates
        or deletes the highest group index, the inference controller sees the pod through its
        watch and adds / removes the cell, the next weight update covers the new engine, and the
        rollout executor re-reads the engine topology before every rollout.
Schedule (SCHEDULE): 2 -> 3 engines while training rollout 2, 3 -> 2 while training rollout 7
Timing: exact - the driver reads the run's own event log (rollout metrics = generation done,
        train/grad_norm = training done, the engine checksum event = weights pushed) and fires only
        while the run stands at the scheduled moment; a missed moment fails, it never fires late
Landing: a resize shows in the run within LANDING_LAG_ROLLOUTS (3) rollouts, and no earlier

Assertions:
  1. Driver: every scheduled resize was applied, replicas read back as asked, the pool started at
     the declared 2
  2. Weight updates: the number of engines each InferenceEngineWeightChecksumEvent covers is 2
     for rollouts before the first landing, 3 between the landings, 2 after the second, each
     landing within the lag window of its resize, plus 2 for the update before rollout 0
  3. Rollout executor topology: the engine gpu count the executor normalized rollout throughput
     by, rebuilt per rollout as num_training_samples x response_len/mean / rollout_time /
     effective_tokens_per_gpu_per_sec, follows the same schedule
  4. Api server: the driver's GET /api/v1/cells readings list at most 3 rollout cells alive and
     Serving at once, and exactly 2 when the run ends
  5. Zero CellReconfigureEvents (no trainer cell moved), and train/grad_norm finite and nonzero
     for all 12 rollouts
```

- **Why not relaunch with a new `--rollout-num-gpus`**: the launcher admits a relaunch whose only difference is a LeaderWorkerSet's `replicas` ("scaling"), but a changed size also changes the resolved `sglang` config every leaf payload carries (`server_groups[].num_gpus`) and the orchestrator's argv, so today it refuses the upgrade; resizing the workload directly is how an operator scales the pool until the size leaves the worker payloads.
- **Why during training**: an engine deleted mid-generation is a crash the rollout ft path already covers in the soaks; the scaling question is whether the run follows a pool that changes size, so the resize lands where nothing is in flight.
- **Why two independent witnesses of the size**: the checksum event counts the engines the trainer pushed to; the throughput denominator is what `InferenceRuntimeMutState` told the rollout executor. One agreeing with the schedule while the other does not is exactly the bug a refactor of the runtime topology would introduce.
- **Why the lag window**: a pod takes seconds to be created and the reflector to see it; the update after the resize's own rollout may or may not include the new engine, the one after it must.
