# Deployment E2E Tests

## Running

Needs `PYTHONPATH=.` and a miles-workbench pod (`MILES_SCRIPT_*` env preset). Kubernetes only:
entries register via `register_cuda_ci` and fail with a reason on any other backend.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python tests/e2e/deploy/test_split_deterministic.py                          # as CI
PYTHONPATH=. python tests/e2e/deploy/conftest_deploy/split/scenario_split_deterministic.py run  # via app
# hot restart is two levels: the mode is a subcommand of its own
PYTHONPATH=. python tests/e2e/deploy/conftest_deploy/hot_restart/scenario_hot_restart_deterministic.py \
    checkpointed run
```

- **Subcommands**: comparison scenarios expose `run` / `baseline` / `target` / `compare` (no GPU) /
  `generate-data`; the multi policy one exposes `run` / `verify`; the realistic soak exposes `run`
  only; hot restart deterministic nests these under one subcommand per mode.
- **Dump dirs**: `$MILES_TEST_DUMPS_ROOT/<run_id>/<TEST_NAME>/`, defaulting to `/node_public/dumps` when
  the cluster sets no root (only `run` deletes it, and only its own run id's subtree; `--dump-dir`
  overrides for `baseline` / `target` / `compare`); multi policy:
  `<output_dir>/multi_policy_solver_verifier/<run_id>/`.

## Test Specifications

### `scenario_split_deterministic`

```
Type: comparison (baseline=one release, target=one release per deployment)
Steps: 3 rollouts

1. Baseline: the whole run in one release
2. Target, installed in order: TRAINER; INFERENCE e0, e1 (one engine each); PRIMARY last
   - installing PRIMARY blocks until the run ends
   - addresses from the example's address_book; ordering, shared run uuid and uninstall from
     conftest_deploy/split/split_deployment.py
   - whatever installed the releases removes them all when the run ends, PRIMARY included, and
     waits for their pods, rather than leaving PRIMARY to the teardown it schedules for itself
3. Compare: dumps and metrics bitwise; engine checksums identical per (rollout, engine); engine
   count; weights moved; nonzero gradients >= 2 rollouts
```

### `scenario_split_multi_policy`

```
Type: single run (multi trainer is not bitwise-reproducible)
Steps: 3 rollouts
Releases: TRAINER solver-actor / verifier-actor, INFERENCE solver / verifier, PRIMARY last

1. Install the five releases via the example, one command per part
2. Assert: every rank trained with its own policy's args; the leader reported every rollout;
   finite nonzero grad_norm/loss. Three rollouts say nothing about learning, so whether a policy
   improves is gated by tests/e2e/long/test_multi_policy_solver_verifier_gsm8k.py instead
3. Assert per policy: train_rollout_logprob_abs_diff <= 0.1 (the cheapest wiring bug - a
   trainer scoring another engine's tokens - shows up here)
```

### `scenario_hot_restart_deterministic`

```
Type: comparison (baseline=untouched, target=same command, orchestration script replaced mid-run)
Steps: 6 rollouts
Releases: baseline and target derive separate releases from the parent run id; every target
          take-over upgrades the target release in place
Timing: exact - the run parks at the scheduled step boundary (sleep-forever action) and the
        driver relaunches it there, so a take-over's landing is pinned, not raced
Plan: a file under the base dump dir, not under either side's, which each run deletes (argv
        stays byte-identical across relaunches; a pod's command carries it)
Gate: the parked run writes a sentinel beside the plan; the driver waits for it
Observation: the cluster observer records a snapshot only once two consecutive reads agree on the
        release's workloads and pods, and afterwards drops any listing missing a settled
        workload, so a topology still being installed is never taken for a run losing pods
Modes: checkpointed  - --save-interval 2 (saves after 1, 3, 5), 2 restarts: restart 1 frozen
                       between steps 2 and 3 (resumes save 1), restart 2 frozen between steps
                       4 and 5 (resumes save 3)
       no_checkpoint - --save-interval 4 (saves after 3 and 5), 1 restart frozen between steps
                       1 and 2, before anything was saved
Entries: test_hot_restart_checkpointed.py, test_hot_restart_no_checkpoint.py

1. Relaunch the same command + --hot-restart orchestration,rollout_executor per the mode, with one
   rollout-executor-only argument changed: --save-debug-rollout-data points at
   <side>/rollout_data/generation_<k>/{rollout_id}.pt, k = the take-over's number (the install is
   generation 0); every other argument is repeated byte for byte
2. Assert workloads: only orchestrator + rollout-executor rolled (pod uid / restartCount / stamps);
   compare canonical PodTemplate fingerprints for every workload because a controller may advance the generation of
   an unchanged custom resource
3. Assert process: one trainer rpc boot uuid throughout, answering the take-over's fresh client, and
   read once off a whole-release snapshot taken before the first take-over stamped anything
4. Assert the changed argument reached the two restarted components and nothing else, off the
   commands of every pod the observer saw (recorded once per pod uid):
   - the successive orchestrator pods carry --save-debug-rollout-data generation_0, _1, ... in their
     argv; the successive rollout-executor pods carry it in their served --config payload
   - no pod of any other workload carries any of those values
   - generation k's directory holds exactly the rollouts that generation generated: 0..frozen_0
     for generation 0, (saved_{k-1}, frozen_k] for the k-th take-over, (saved_last, 5] for the
     last - so the relaunched executor demonstrably ran with its new arguments
5. Assert redo, measured off the logs, per mode:
   - checkpointed: one .trash_* per restart; resume point == the pinned save (the snapshot
     beside that checkpoint), so the run resumed there, not at step 0; the redone steps are
     exactly the pinned (save, frozen step] windows; per-step attempts all 1 or 2
   - no_checkpoint: record carries no saved iteration; exactly one .trash_*, holding the log
     thrown away (steps 0..1, each once) and sharing no step with the log that replaced it; the
     surviving log describes each of the 6 steps exactly once; the run still saves after the
     restart, past the step it was frozen at
6. Compare: bitwise as in scenario_split_deterministic, engine checksums included, with one
   exemption - rollout/weight_version mean/median/max/min. The trainer outlives a take-over, so
   its weight update counter keeps counting through the steps the target redoes and stands
   ahead of the baseline's at the same step

checkpointed lands every take-over on a non-save step, so unsaved steps are rolled back and
redone; no_checkpoint has nothing to resume from, so its event log is moved aside and it starts
over at rollout 0 with the run.
```

- **Why `--save-debug-rollout-data`**: it is read by the rollout executor alone (a `DebugRolloutOnlyConfig` field), so a relaunch that changes it must leave the trainer and inference-controller payloads byte-identical - which the launcher enforces by refusing any other diff - and what it does is visible on disk without touching a single training bit, so the bitwise comparison against the baseline still holds.
- **Why the pod commands and not only the files**: the files prove the restarted executor ran the new value; the orchestrator reads nothing off this flag, so its argv is the only place its take-over can show it took the new arguments.

### `scenario_hot_restart_realistic_gsm8k`

```
Type: single run, ft's scenario_realistic_gsm8k with hot restarts instead of kills
Steps: as scenario_realistic_gsm8k
Injection: HotRestartFaultForm at random intervals through the ordinary cell fault scheduler,
        seed logged
Eligibility: two healthy virtual cells; the form does not harm its target, so both remain eligible
        after a take-over without pretending a real trainer or rollout cell was targeted
Terminal lifecycle: the form reads progress from the same dump directory as checkpoints and events;
        the virtual-cell provider returns no targets after rollout 234, leaving rollouts 235-249
        free of new take-overs
Landing signal: both replaced workloads (orchestrator, rollout-executor) carry a stamp other
        than the one they carried at the draw - rewritten, not added
Observation: as in scenario_hot_restart_deterministic - snapshots start after the release settles
Load-bearing: adds --save/--load and --save-interval 3 (bounds one take-over's cost); mean draw
        interval 600s (--hot-restart-interval-seconds)

1. Run the realistic gsm8k recipe while the plan injects hot restarts
2. Assert: gsm8k reward improves as in scenario_realistic_gsm8k
3. Assert: >= MIN_HOT_RESTARTS take-overs landed; no injection attempt failed; every relaunch
   thread finished without raising (where the run's own metric verdict surfaces); each landed
   take-over stamped orchestrator and rollout-executor once; no other workload rolled or lost a
   pod; one trainer boot uuid throughout, first read before any take-over stamped a workload; no
   take-over threw away more than MAX_REDONE_STEPS_PER_TAKE_OVER = SAVE_INTERVAL + 1 steps - one
   save interval, plus the one step the checkpoint tracker read at the draw may still lag the
   save the run had just written; and the same bound again against the resume point measured
   after the fact - one .trash_* per take-over, read in the order the logs were rolled aside (a
   take-over can fire while the run is still catching up, so how far a log trained says nothing
   about which take-over left it), the log that followed one keeping a prefix of the log it
   replaced, and the steps past that prefix being what the take-over cost
4. Artifact: per take-over cost (index, checkpoint held, step reached) in
   <dump_dir>/hot_restart/evidence.json

Hot restart rides the ft injection machinery so a future soak can mix it with pod kills.
